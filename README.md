A Detail-Oriented Analysis of Cyclistic: A Chicago Bike-Sharing Company
Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-sharing program, operates over 5,800 bicycles and 692 docking stations across the city, catering to diverse rider needs through traditional bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes. The program offers three pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Financial analysis indicates yearly members are significantly more profitable than casual riders, prompting Cyclistic to explore strategies to convert casual riders into yearly members.


This analysis aims to answer the question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? By uncovering insights into usage patterns, this project aims to provide actionable recommendations to guide marketing strategies for increasing annual memberships.


Key Stakeholders:
Cyclistic’s Marketing Analytics Team: Tasked with leveraging insights for data-driven decisions.

The Director of Marketing: Responsible for overseeing marketing strategies and campaigns.

The Executive Team: Focused on long-term growth and profitability.

Data Source

This analysis utilizes [Cyclistic’s Historical Trip Data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) from January 1, 2023, to December 30, 2023. The data is distributed in 12 monthly CSV files and adheres to licensing rules by [Motivate International Inc](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdivvybikes.com%2Fdata-license-agreement). While reliable, accurate, and consistent, the data has certain limitations:

Privacy Restrictions: It excludes personal details, preventing analysis of casual riders' residential areas or repeat purchases.
Financial Insights: It lacks ticket price data, making it difficult to assess casual riders' spending compared to annual membership costs.
Despite these limitations, the dataset provides valuable information for understanding trip durations, ride patterns, bike preferences, and temporal trends.
